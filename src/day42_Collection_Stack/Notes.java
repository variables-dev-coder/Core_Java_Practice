Stack in Java (Collection Framework)
1. Definition
    A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
    In Java, it is implemented as a class Stack<E> which extends Vector<E>.
    This means Stack inherits all features of Vector, but also adds special methods for stack operations.

  ↳ Collection
      ↳ List
          ↳ Vector
              ↳ Stack
