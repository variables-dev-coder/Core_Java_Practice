    1️⃣ Java Introduction, JVM, JDK, JRE
    Concept
    JDK (Java Development Kit) → Contains tools for developing Java apps (compiler javac, debugger, libraries, JVM)
    JRE (Java Runtime Environment) → Runs Java programs (JVM + libraries)
    JVM (Java Virtual Machine) → Converts Java bytecode into machine code for your OS
    Java is platform-independent because code is compiled into bytecode, which the JVM executes on any OS.

    /*

    Interview Questions
    What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
    Why is Java platform-independent?
    What is bytecode?
    Is JVM platform-independent? (No – JVM is OS-specific, but bytecode is portable)
