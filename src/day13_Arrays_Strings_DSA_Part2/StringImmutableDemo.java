Why String is Immutable in Java?

Explanation:
In Java, a String is immutable, meaning once created, its value cannot be changed.
If you try to modify it, a new String object is created instead of changing the original.

Reasons:
1. String Pool Optimization
    - Strings are stored in the String Constant Pool to save memory. If they were mutable,
      changing one reference would unintentionally change all others pointing to the same object.

2. Security
    - Strings are widely used in sensitive areas (e.g., file paths, network URLs,
      database credentials). Immutability prevents malicious code from altering them after creation.

3. Thread-Safety
     - Since strings cannot be changed, they are inherently thread-safe â€” multiple threads
       can share them without synchronization
